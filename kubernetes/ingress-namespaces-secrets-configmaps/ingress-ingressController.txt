Ingress and Ingress Controller

An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.
Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

What is ingress?
Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to service within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules
defined on the ingress resourse.

Here is a simple example where an ingress sends all its traffic to one service.

Client -> Ingress maintained load balancer -> Cluster -> Ingress -> routing rule -> Service -> to different pods

An Ingress does not expose arbitrary ports or protocols. Exposing services other than HTTP and HTTPS to the internet typically uses
a service of type Service.Type=NodePort or Service.Type=LoadBalancer.

Ingress Controller

Our control plane (master node) had a controller manager running.
The kube-controller-manager runs a bunch of controllers like
Replicaset controller
Deployment controller

If you want to add an ingress to your kubernetes cluster, you need to install an ingress controller manually. It doesnâ€™t come by default in k8s
