NRQL (New Relic Query Language) is a SQL-like query language used to query data within New Relic, a monitoring and observability platform.
NRQL allows users to perform complex data analysis and create custom dashboards and alerts by querying their application and infrastructure
performance data stored in New Relic.

Fetch all CPU usage

SELECT average(cpuPercent) AS `CPU used %` FROM SystemSample WHERE (entityGuid = 'xyz') TIMESERIES AUTO

Filter by High CPU Usage

SELECT average(cpuPercent) AS `CPU used %`
FROM SystemSample
WHERE (entityGuid = 'NDQ2MDY2NXxJTkZSQXxOQXwzOTczMjM4ODc0NzI4NDk0NzYz') AND cpuPercent > 2
TIMESERIES AUTO

Multiple graphs in the same timeline

SELECT average(transmitBytesPerSecond) AS `Transmit bytes per second`, average(receiveBytesPerSecond) AS `Receive bytes per second` FROM NetworkSample WHERE (entityGuid = 'NDQ2MDY2NXxJTkZSQXxOQXwtMzE2MTI3OTkyNzM3NDEzMTE1Mw') TIMESERIES AUTO

Facets

SELECT average(cpuPercent) AS `CPU used %`
FROM SystemSample
WHERE entityGuid IN ('xyz', 'abc')
FACET entityGuid
TIMESERIES AUTO

Metrics on logs

You can add metrics on top of log counts (esp for errors) to catch if a certain error is being thrown too often/there is a spike.

SELECT count(`message`) FROM Log WHERE (`entity.guid` = 'NDQ2MDY2NXxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NTY0ODg2NzU5' OR
`entity.guids` LIKE '%NDQ2MDY2NXxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NTY0ODg2NzU5%' OR `service_name` = 'test' OR `serviceName` = 'test'
OR `service.name` = 'test' OR `entity.name` = 'test') AND (level='error') TIMESERIES AUTO

You can also add individual set of metrics on individual errors

AND message LIKE '%there was an error%'
